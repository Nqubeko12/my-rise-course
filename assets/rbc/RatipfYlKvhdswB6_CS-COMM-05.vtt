00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.920
<v ->Your customers are outside of your organization,</v>

2
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.300
but they're essential to your business.

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.432
And not just because they buy the products

4
00:00:11.432 --> 00:00:13.095
or services you sell.

5
00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:17.830
When you work within an organization, day in and day out,

6
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.270
seeing opportunities for improvement can be challenging.

7
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.580
But a customer who is on the outside

8
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.670
can clearly see what's working and what's not.

9
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.060
Their perspective can help you get better

10
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.150
if you care enough to ask for their feedback.

11
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.350
So how can you start soliciting feedback?

12
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.453
And once you hear from customers, how do you respond?

13
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.390
Start developing your solicitation methods

14
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.070
by considering your customers first.

15
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.460
What approach fits with your audience?

16
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.980
Use this frame of reference

17
00:00:50.885 --> 00:00:52.860
to inform your strategy development.

18
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.370
In general, people respond to a request for feedback

19
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.890
when it's personal.

20
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.430
For example, if you speak with customers regularly,

21
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.220
you can ask for feedback directly.

22
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.250
Customers who prefer to correspond via email

23
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.770
or chat will probably respond more favorably

24
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.360
to feedback requests they receive through those channels.

25
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.283
Regardless of how you solicit it,

26
00:01:17.206 --> 00:01:19.500
the choice to provide feedback should also be low pressure

27
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.363
for your customers, make it an option not a requirement.

28
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.850
Finally, customers should know that their feedback

29
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.170
is purposeful.

30
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.200
They're more likely to provide comments

31
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.670
if they know they'll be making a difference.

32
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.943
Make it clear that their opinion matters to your business.

33
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.078
After considering your customer's expectations,

34
00:01:41.078 --> 00:01:43.460
choose what questions you'll ask

35
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.210
based on the information you're seeking.

36
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.900
For example, if you're aiming to improve your product,

37
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.500
you could ask customers how it's impacted their lives.

38
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.760
Or if you'd like to evaluate your marketing plan,

39
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.050
you could ask how customers found your business.

40
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.810
Once you have your questions,

41
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.430
choose solicitation methods that are appropriate

42
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.970
for your audience.

43
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.070
From email surveys to website pop-ups,

44
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.470
to good old fashioned phone calls,

45
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.020
you have many options to choose from.

46
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.800
Select one or a few methods that best fit your customers

47
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.223
and your questions.

48
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.720
As feedback begins to come in,

49
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.770
you'll notice positive comments, negative comments

50
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.600
and all sorts of comments in between.

51
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.350
Creating unique responses to these comments

52
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.670
will show your customers

53
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.053
that you genuinely value their opinion.

54
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.030
While a generic response won't cover

55
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.450
all the different feedback you might receive,

56
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.450
you can follow some general tips, first, express gratitude.

57
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.790
No matter what a comment says, a customer took time

58
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.760
out of their day to share their opinion with you.

59
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.450
Show them you appreciate the gesture.

60
00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.260
Next, remember that feedback is tied to marketing.

61
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.660
Always respond knowing that other people might read

62
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.350
or hear about your responses.

63
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.690
Also, practice empathy.

64
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.550
You may feel emotional after hearing feedback,

65
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.350
especially if it's negative and that's understandable,

66
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.780
but think about feedback as an opportunity to learn

67
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:18.873
and improve.

68
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.060
One way to practice empathy is to listen actively,

69
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.030
clarify the root of the problem

70
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.650
and present yourself as an ally, not an enemy.

71
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.330
You may find that your most significant improvements

72
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.118
result from negative feedback.

73
00:03:34.118 --> 00:03:37.238
Next, be curious.

74
00:03:37.238 --> 00:03:40.910
Ask questions to clarify what the customer means.

75
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.884
This is especially important for vague or neutral feedback.

76
00:03:44.884 --> 00:03:47.860
When you get a customer to be more specific,

77
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.330
you gain more information.

78
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.820
You can also consider offering more.

79
00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.862
A dissatisfied customer is usually seeking solutions,

80
00:03:55.862 --> 00:04:00.680
but you can also use this strategy with happy customers.

81
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.520
For example, if someone provides a glowing product review,

82
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.050
you could suggest other products they might enjoy

83
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.400
or offer a discount on a future purchase.

84
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.620
Finally, make sure you pass feedback along to others

85
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.880
who need to hear it.

86
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.930
These individuals might even help you develop your responses

87
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.023
to customers.

88
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.890
While not always easy to hear,

89
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.040
feedback is crucial to growing your business.

90
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.630
That's because customers see things that can allude you

91
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.560
as you go about your daily business.

92
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.610
So invite them into your process.

93
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.840
As your customers share their comments,

94
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.000
show them that you genuinely care about their feedback

95
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.720
by providing personalized responses.

96
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.000
You'll get valuable ideas and form powerful connections

97
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.173
in the process.
